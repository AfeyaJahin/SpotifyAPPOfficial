## Project Description
Spotify Social is an application used to connect Spotify listeners around the world. By logging into your Spotify account through our app, you are agreeing that we can access your listening history, including liked songs, top songs, and top artists. Once logged in, Spotify Social is a place where you can view summaries of your own listening history, as well as explore other peoplesâ€™. For anyone who has a public account (which is editable on your profile page), they will be displayed on the Discover page, where other users can see your liked songs, top songs, and top artists. We have also added more social features to the application, such as a Forums page, where people can create forums, as well as create and interact with posts on specific forums. Additionally, we have added a chat feature where you can directly message other users of the application. Overall, the purpose of this app was to make Spotify a more connected experience and to allow for people to connect based on their music choices, which is a space that has been empty for too long now.
